In early 2017, Booker joined Republicans to vote against a measure that would
have allowed prescription drugs to be imported from Canada. The pharmaceutical
industry is against the idea. [roll call of
vote](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=115&session=1&vote=00020#position)
In response to the reaction, Booker issued a statement (bottom of [this
page](https://theslot.jezebel.com/for-some-reason-cory-booker-and-12-other-dems-killed-a-1791116094))
saying that it was because importing drugs from Canada could be dangerous. He
also
[told](https://theintercept.com/2017/06/30/cory-booker-will-pause-fundraising-from-big-pharma-because-it-arouses-so-much-criticism/)
NPR that he would stop accepting money from big pharma, *"Because it arouses so
much criticism."*

Heidi Heitkamp also voted *against* the measure. Warren voted *for* the measure.
